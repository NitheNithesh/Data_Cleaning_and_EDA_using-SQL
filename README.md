# Data_Cleaning_and_EDA_using-SQL

Hi Everyone!

In this project, we used a layoffs dataset, which is a concerning topic for many working professionals. The layoff data contained many null values and incomplete details of companies that had laid off employees. Our goal was to transform this unorganized data into meaningful insights by removing null values, standardizing data, and transforming columns. This process increased the dataset's information by 30%.

After data cleaning, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data, examining various aspects and conditions of layoffs by different companies and industries worldwide. We ranked companies and industries, such as the top 3 companies with the highest total number of employees and the fewest layoffs, and industries with the highest layoffs.

This analysis helps identify trends, patterns, and types of industries that have laid off employees over time. We cleaned about 20% of the data, making it more meaningful and insightful regarding the companies that laid off employees at different times.

I learned this from @AlexTheAnalyst using his provided dataset, which can be found here: [layoffs dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv). Inspired by his techniques, I further cleaned and transformed the data to gain deeper insights. Beyond what I learned from Alex, I made additional improvements to highlight the areas I developed independently.
